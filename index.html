            <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
            <p>I've had an interest in technology since an early age, but not in development. My first interest was in security and I competed in competitions for it. Later my interests in computer science widened and I became interested in programming and taught myself C++ along with the basics of Python, JavaScript, C# and MySQL. With these accomplishments I decided to return to College and work towards my degree in computer science, but quickly found that the curriculum mnoved too slow. Upon realizing this I began researching a program I had heard of previously, Lambda School, after completing my research I found that if was the better choice for me. So I applied and was accepted after completed several challenges In the two weeks before attending Lambda I taught myself HTML and CSS in addition to reviewing JavaScript. I'm a self starter and I'm intensely driven.</p>
